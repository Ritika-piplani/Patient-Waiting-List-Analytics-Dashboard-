# Patient-Waiting-List-Analytics-Dashboard-
An interactive dashboard created to track and analyze a healthcare patient waiting list, focusing on key metrics, historical trends, and detailed demographic and specialty breakdowns.
## Short Description / Purpose
The Patient Waiting List Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI report designed to help healthcare administrators and analysts track the current status of patient waiting lists. It provides insights into historical trends, allowing for comparisons between inpatient and outpatient data, and offers detailed analysis by patient specialty and age profile. This tool is intended for data-driven professionals seeking to understand and manage patient flow more effectively.
## Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

Power BI Desktop – The primary data visualization platform used for report creation.

Power Query Editor – Used for data transformation and cleaning.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Utilized for creating dynamic measures and custom calculations.

PowerPoint – Used for designing the dashboard background images and overall layout.

File Format – The project uses Excel files for the primary dataset and a CSV file for a mapping table.

## Data Source
Source: A publicly available healthcare dataset.

Data on a patient waiting list, including both inpatient and outpatient categories. The data is provided in multiple Excel files, with separate files for each year from 2018 to 2021. An additional CSV file was manually created to map and group various specialties.

## Features / Highlights
### Business Problem
The healthcare system often struggles with managing and analyzing patient waiting lists. Key questions such as:

What is the current size of the waiting list?

How do current waiting times compare to previous years?

Which specialties or age groups have the longest waits?

### Goal of the Dashboard
#### To deliver an interactive visual tool that:

Tracks the current status of the patient waiting list.

Analyzes historical monthly trends.

Performs detailed specialty and age-profile analysis.

### Walkthrough of Key Visuals

### Business Impact & Insights

Operational Management: Administrators can use the dashboard to monitor and manage the patient waiting list in real-time.

Strategic Planning: The analysis of historical trends and specialty breakdowns can help in resource allocation and strategic planning.

Decision-Making: The tool enables data-driven decisions to optimize patient care and reduce waiting times.
